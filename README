NOTE: ttylinux and crosslinux appear to no longer be maintained and the mailing lists are no longer around either. I am doing what I can to build ttylinux using what was last available.  While I have made it through the entire build process, I have yet to produce a working ISO.

crosslinux is a relatively simple build system for making a small family of
small Linux systems for several CPU architectures.  crosslinux is the build
system for ttylinux.  See the files in the doc/ directory.
