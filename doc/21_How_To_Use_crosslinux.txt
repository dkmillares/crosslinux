        ----------------------------------------------------------------
        This file describes the steps for using crosslinux to make
        ttylinux-i486; this shows how to use most of the crosslinux
        build tool capabilities.
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
1. Initial Conditions for These Examples
----------------------------------------

In the following example script commands, crosslinux is installed into
~/projects/crosslinux; this is different from the source directory of
crosslinux that you downloaded, which also was the crosslinux build directory.
Remember from "11_How_To_Install_crosslinux.txt" that you have downloaded a
crosslinux directory tree and you did "./configure <options>" and
"make install" commands in that directory: in this case you installed
crosslinux from that build directory into ~/projects/crosslinux, and now you
want to use the installed crosslinux build tool.

From "12_How_To_Setup_crosstool-NG.txt", the cross-tool chain builder,
crosstool-NG, is installed in the directory ~/projects/crosstool-ng-1.18.0/

So for the examples in this file, you have these directories:

~/projects/cl-dev/ ................ original crosslinux source/build directory
~/projects/crosslinux/ ............ crosslinux installed in here
~/projects/crosstool-ng-1.18.0/ ... crosstool-NG installed in here

------------------
2. Start a Project
------------------

You make an arbitrary new directory and begin (cross) building your target
Linux system.  You can make several new empty directories and each have a
different target Linux system build, each in its own state of build progress.

Go to an empty directory; maybe a new directory named for the kind of target
Linux system you want to make, like "ttylinux-i486".

You need to have the installed crosslinux bin directory in your PATH so you can
make crosslinux commands.  crosslinux was installed with a very small script
you can "source" to add the installed crosslinux path to PATH; this script is
smart enough to add to PATH only if needed, so you can use it multiple times
without growing PATH more than needed.

$ mkdir ~/projects/ttylinux-i486
$ cd ~/projects/ttylinux-i486
$ source ~/crosslinux/bin/setenv.sh

Now you are ready to give crosslinux build tool commands.  There is one basic
command: cl-bt.  You can give the command with no arguments and it will give
you some terse help.

$ cl-bt  # do this to see the terse help text

The command you need to use to initialize the directory for building your
target Linux system is 'cl-bt bt-init'.  Use this command and then look at the
directory; there are a number of new directories that will be used while
building the target system.

Next, you would want to make a configuration file that defines the target Linux
system to build.  Use the 'cl-bt menuconfig' command and explore the
configuration options.  When you are done, save the configuration file and
notice the new "crosslinux-config.sh" file; this is the crosslinux configuration
file.

Notice that the default configuration when you use 'cl-bt menuconfig' with no
existing configuration file is a minimal i486 configuration.  It should work.

After you have a crosslinux configuration file, use 'cl-bt dload' to download
the needed source packages.  You may not want to do this yet because you will
delete this configuration file in the next step.

-----------------------------------
3. Make Site-specific Customization
-----------------------------------

Notive the ~/projects/cl-dev/integ directory has a ttylinux-i486-<version>
directory.  This directory has the crosslinux configuration for making the
latest version of ttylinux-i486.

Remove any crosslinux-config.sh file youmay have created in your project
directory and copy the ttylinux-i486 crosslinux configuration file.  Also,
untar the site directory that has some build-time customization that makes
the target Linux system be ttylinux-i486.  Use the actual version number for
<version> in the example script commands below.

$ rm crosslinux-config.sh
$ cp ~/projects/cl-dev/integ/ttylinux-i486-<version>/crosslinux-config.sh .
$ tar xf ~/projects/cl-dev/integ/ttylinux-i486-<version>/site.tbz

You can understand most of the site directory by looking through the menuconfig
items and the items in the site directory.  An explanation of all the items in
the site directory is beyond the current scope of this file, but is planned.

Make the list of packages and the loader list, and then download the needed
source packages.

$ cl-bt pkglist
$ cl-bt ldrlist
$ cl-bt dload

-------------------------------
4. Link to the Cross-tool Chain
-------------------------------

At this point you need to command 'cl-bt menuconfig' and examine the
ttylinux-i486 configuration.  Look through each section.  Notice the first
section has the ttylinux "brand" name and release name and release version.
The distribution website entry is put into the target system's init script
and is printed when the target system boots.

See the third section "Cross-tool Chain and Build Configuration".  Look at
the help for the first four items.  The path to the cross-tool chain bin
directory is the crosslinux build tool primary link to the cross-tool chain.

You now should be thinking: I don't have an i486 cross-tool chain; all I have
is a cross-tool chan builder.  Now is time to build the i486 cross-tool chain,
but you first needed to see the expected location of the cross-tool chain in
this crosslinux configuration file.

As you see the default for all the actual cross-tool chains is in ~/x-tools,
and this specific i486 cross-tool chain is expected to be in
~/x-tools/i486-generic-linux-gnu/; an x86_64 cross-tool chain would be in
~/x-tools/x86_64-generic-linux-gnu/, and so on.

You can use some location other than ~/x-tools, but you need to change it in
this crosslinux configuration file, and in the crosstool-NG configuration file
which you are about to use.  These must match or the crosslinux build tool
won't find the cross-tool chain nor the Linux kernel source from the
"Path to Cross-tool Chain Target Manifest".

-----------------------------
5. Build the Cross-tool Chain
-----------------------------

~/projects/cl-dev/integ/ttylinux-i486-<version>/crosstool-ng.config is the
crosstool-NG configuration file used to make the i486 cross-tool chain.  Copy
this file to the crosstool-NG directory and give the command to make the
cross-tool chain.

$ cd ~/projects/crosstool-ng-1.18.0/
$ cp ~/projects/cl-dev/integ/ttylinux-i486-<version>/crosstool-ng.config .config
$ ./ct-ng build

Have a coffee; the cross-tool chain build will take a few minutes.  Maybe go
back to the crosslinux project directory, ~/projects/ttylinux-i486, and play
with cl-bt commands, like 'cl-bt bt-showcfg', or maybe play with menuconfig,
'cl-bt menuconfig'.

--------------------------------
6. Build the Target Linux System
--------------------------------

After making the i486 cross-tool chain go to the crosslinux project directory,
~/projects/ttylinux-i486, and make the bootable target Linux system ISO image.

$ cd  ~/projects/ttylinux-i486
$ source ~/crosslinux/bin/setenv.sh # if you haven't done this in this terminal
$ cl-bt dist

Or, make the bootable target Linux system ISO image in several steps.

$ cd  ~/projects/ttylinux-i486
$ source ~/crosslinux/bin/setenv.sh # if you haven't done this in this terminal
$ cl-bt clean
$ cl-bt pkgs
$ cl-bt loader
$ cl-bt kernel
$ cl-bt rootfs
$ cl-bt bootfs
$ cl-bt bootimg

Find the ISO image file in the target/image/ directory.
