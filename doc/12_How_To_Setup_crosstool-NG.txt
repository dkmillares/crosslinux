1. Overview and Digression
--------------------------

You need a cross-tool chain in order to cross-build the source packages and
Linux kernel.  A Linux-based cross-tool chain used to make other Linux systems
has several programs; it is made from bintutils, gcc, Linux kernel header
files, and a C library such as eglibc, glibc, uClibc.
[info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Binutils]
[info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection]
[info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uclibc]
[info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eglibc]
[info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc]

crosslinux does not supply a cross-tool chain.  crosslinux is developed and
tested using cross-tool chains created by crosstool-NG.
[ref http://crosstool-ng.org/]

There are a few points to clearly understand about cross-tool chains used to
make a Linux system:

=> The compiler and binutils programs are made to run on the build machine like
   any other program on the build machine; they are not themselves
   cross-compiled to make the cross-tool chain.  An incomplete list of these
   cross-tool chain programs for a i486 target might be:
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-ar
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-as
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-c++
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-cc
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-cpp
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-g++
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-gcc
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-ld
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-nm
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-objcopy
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-objdump
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-ranlib
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-readelf
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-size
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-strings
   i486-generic-linux-gnu-strip

=> The C library files ARE themselves cross-compiled binary libraries that are
   linked to the software being cross-built by the cross-tool chain.  These C
   library files are part of the cross-tool chain, but they cannot run on the
   build machine.

=> A set of Linux kernel header files is needed.  The C library for Linux
   systems contains functions that make use of Linux kernel system calls;
   therefore, the cross-built target C library needs to have been built with
   Linux Kernel header files.  The version of the Linux kernel header files
   defines the target system's Linux kernel interface version.  When you have a
   running cross-compiled system, do not try to use a Linux kernel older than
   the Linux kernel version that supplied the Linux kernel header files used to
   cross-build the C library.

--------------------
2. License Awareness
--------------------

If you deliver, either as sold or given-away, or otherwise publish a crosslinux
build-tool End Product, you must be aware that you are "delivering" as binary
files the C library, AND ANY PATCHES THE CROSS-TOOL CHAIN BUILDER USED ON THE
C LIBRARY SOURCES, that came from the cross-tool chain, as all the cross-built
packages are linked to it.

The crosslinux build tool tries to help automate the fetching and aggregating
of all the needed source code files and patches from the cross-tool chain's
build system, crosstool-NG, to help you and me comply with GPL licensing.

-------------------
3. Get crosstool-NG
-------------------

Look in the crosslinux integ/ directory; you will see at least one directory
with a crosstool-ng-<version> name.  Download the latest crosstool-NG version
you see in the integ/ directory.

crosstool-NG Web Site ......... http://crosstool-ng.org/

You will download a file named something like "crosstool-ng-1.18.0.tar.bz2".
Think about where you want to untar this, it will create a corresponding
top-level directory named something like "crosstool-ng-1.18.0", and you will
need to keep this directory and another separate directory at the same level
for a while.

This other separate directory comes from the integ/crosstool-ng-<version>/
directory; it is named "tools-patches.tbz".  Untar the 
integ/crosstool-ng-<version>/tools-patches.tbz file to the same directory in
which you untar the downloaded crosstool-ng-<version>.tar.bz file.

For an example:
--------------
You've previously downloaded crosslinux and its files are in directory
~/projects/cl-dev/ and you have downloaded crosstool-ng-1.18.0.tar.bz into a
common ~/Download directory.  You now want to untar crosstool-ng-1.18.0.tar.bz
and ~/projects/cl-dev/integ/crosstool-ng-1.18.0/tools-patches.tbz

$ cd ~/projects
$ tar xf ~/Download/crosstool-ng-1.18.0.tar.bz
$ tar xf ~/projects/cl-dev/integ/crosstool-ng-1.18.0/tools-patches.tbz

You now have directories:

~/projects/crosstool-ng-1.18.0/
~/projects/crosstool-patches/

You need to keep both of these directory trees until any and all cross-tool
chains have been built.

-----------------------
4. Install crosstool-NG
-----------------------

There are a couple ways to install crosstool-NG for then using to make various
cross-tool chains.  The instructions here describe the "Hacker's way" which
actually is the more common way; it also is more tidy and doesn't create yet
another directory tree.

Do these steps, where <version> is the version of crosstool-NG you've actually
downloaded and is in the directory name.  In the above example <version> is
"1.18.0".  You might want to copy these steps into an editor, remove the "$ "
prompts, replace <version> with the actual version, and then one-at-a-time
copy-paste each line into a terminal window.

NOTE: The patch is necessary only if there actually is a patch to apply; there
      may be no patch (check it first), in which case it already as been
      incorporated into crosstool-NG.

$ cd ~/Download/crosstool-ng-<version>
$ ./bootstrap
$ patch -p1 <../cl-dev/integ/crosstool-ng-<version>/export-manifest.patch
$ ./configure --enable-local
$ make
$ ./ct-ng updatetools

The patch gives crosstool-NG the ability to export source code packages of the
target system C library and Linux kernel, and all patches applied to them.
This is needed to get the default Linux kernel source code for crosslinux to
use to build the target system.  This also is needed for GPL compliance when
delivering target Linux systems created by crosslinux.

You now can make cross-tool chains.  How to do this for crosslinux is explained
in "21_How_To_Use_crosslinux.txt".
